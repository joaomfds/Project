#PROJECT
##Start Web Development vs Android Development Comparison

This project will focus on the first steps of development on a local machine. Given the economic constrains of most of the world population and my own beliefs I will focus on Cost Free Solutions.
The initial Project Proposal of my MSc Project pertained to Web Applications (WA) vs Native Applications (NA) and intended to be comparison of the difficulties encountered when attempting to develop WA with capabilities that were exclusive to NA, but as I researched more and more into the matter I came to believe that these limitations are increasingly rare and depend mostly on the Developer's skill within each Development Environment than limitations of the tecnologies itself.


1. The platform of choice for more than 80% of the worlds population that uses smartphones is Android

2. Android Cellphones per price segment (memory, CPU, storage capacity)

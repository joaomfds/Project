#TODO LIST

##User Feed
    Remove dummy buttons
    Cleanup the Image insert button and text field
    Ensure everything is visible regardless of screen size

##User List

    Idea to make the user list clickable - add to it's code:
    - In the <text> function create a unique ID like userName + i
    - Create a onclick Listener, listening to a click on that ID
    - Create the code to show that user's pictures (most should already be done)
